title: Solace Messaging Troubleshooting 
owner: Partners

This topic describes how operators and developers can troubleshoot instances of Solace Messaging services.

A [Solace Messaging Service Instance](service-instances.html) is backed by a Message VPN on one or many Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR), depending on the chosen Plan.

You can discover the VMR(s) backing a Service Instance from the [Solace Messaging Credentials](credentials.html) which become available by [binding](bindings.html) an app to the instance or [creating a service key](service-keys.html) for the instance.

##<a id='operator'></a>Operator Troubleshooting

The operator will have access to the logs of all the components of Solace Messaging for PCF.

* Service Broker Logs
* VMR Logs
* VMR Agent Logs

An installation of Solace Messaging for PCF may be configured to use [System Logging](installing.html#optional_system_logging) as a means of gathering all logs.

###<a id='operator_logs'></a>Accessing logs 

The following locations in Solace Messaging BOSH VMs will hold logs of interest that can help in troubleshooting issues.

* All VM job logs
 * /var/vcap/sys/log
* All VMR Logs
 * /var/vcap/store/prepare_vmr/volumes/jail/logs

To access service broker logs, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.82.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. Target the `solace` org and `solace-messaging` space.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf target -o solace -s solace-messaging
	api endpoint:   https://api.local.pcfdev.io
	api version:    2.82.0
	user:           admin
	org:            solace
	space:          solace-messaging
	</pre>
1. Discover the Solace Messaging Service Broker App name.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf apps
	Gettings apps in org solace /space solace-messaging as user@example.com...
	OK

	name                              requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
	solace-messaging-1.2.0            started           1/1         1G       512M   solace-messaging.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN

	OK
	</pre>
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Take note of the application name. In this case 'solace-messaging-1.2.0'</p>
1. To watch the logs of Solace Messaging Service Broker
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf logs solace-messaging-1.2.0 | tee saved_solace-messaging-1.2.0.txt
	Retrieving logs for app solace-messaging-1.2.0 in org solace /space solace-messaging as user@example.com...
	....
	</pre>

###<a id='operator_diag'></a>Additional Diagnostics

  In addition to regular logging, VMR tools can help gather diagnotics logs on demand.

For example, having identified a problem with a given Solace Service Instance, the operator can access the backing VMR to examine logs and gather diagnositics.

The backing VMR for a given Service Instance can be identified from the IPs used in the bindings or service keys.

Alternatively the IP mentioned in the service broker logs or message when an exception occurs.

The operator should look for the VM in the Solace Messaging bosh deployment with the matching IP.

1. Getting additional diagnostics from "Large-VMR/0" VM.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh ssh Large-VMR/0
  # sudo -i
  # /var/vcap/jobs/vmr\_agent/bin/gather\_diagnostics.sh
  </pre>
Then you can look at the gathered logs under /var/vcap/store/prepare_vmr/volumes/jail/logs

###<a id='upgrade_errors'></a>Upgrade Issues

The following issues may arise while upgrading a tile:

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr><th>Error</th>
<td>
<pre class="terminal">
Action Failed get_task: result: 1 of 1 drain scripts failed. Failed Jobs: containers.
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Explanation</th><td>The above can happen when BOSH is shutting down VMs in a High Availability group. This is because the HA group is not in a good state and is preventing the VM to shutdown is necessary to avoid service interruption.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Possible Action</th><td>The user should log into the failing VM and look at the log file located at /var/vcap/sys/log/containers/drain.stdout.log to determine the underlying cause.</td></tr>
</table>

<br>

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr><th>Error</th>
<td>
<pre class="terminal">
Action Failed get_task: result: 1 of 1 post-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: containers.
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Explanation</th><td>While upgrading a High Availability pair,  the VMR that was just upgraded will rejoin the HA group and synchronize its message-spool with the active router. If the synchronization fails to progress then the post-start script will fail and the above error will be displayed in ops manager.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Possible Action</th><td>The user should log into the failing VM and look at the log file located at /var/vcap/sys/log/containers/post-start.stdout.log to determine the underlying cause.</td></tr>
</table>


##<a id='developer'></a>Developer Troubleshooting

A Developer using Solace Messaging for PCF may encounter errors when using Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic operations on a Solace Messaging for PCF service instance.

In general most errors are about these types:

 * Reaching limits ( plan limits, inventory fully used )
 * Communication problems between the Service Broker and the VM inventory it manages
 * Unexpected health state, such as degraded High Availability setup

While this list it not complete, it provides representative samples with explanations and possible resolutions, some of the resolutions will require operator intervention.

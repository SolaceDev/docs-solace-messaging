Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) enables developers to take advantage of the leading multi-cloud, multi-protocol messaging solution which makes app inter-connectivity easy and makes production apps scalable, robust, high-performant, and easy to manage.  

Solace Messaging was designed to be deployed across all your IT environments including your non-cloud datacenter, all leading public clouds ([AWS](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/amazon-web-services/), [Azure](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/azure/) and [Google Cloud Platform](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/google-cloud/)) and the popular Platform as a Service, PCF, in order to provide a uniform messaging fabric for all your apps and to connect all your apps no matter where they are deployed.

Solace Messaging supports all kinds of messaging APIs, QoS, and data streaming as part of one platform across all clouds in a high performance, WAN optimized, easy to manage solution. It's easily deployed in your public and private cloud environments and forms the perfect backbone for single or multi-cloud messaging support of your cloud native micro-services, IoT, big data capture, and next generation digital apps.

Solace Messaging for PCF provides plans for both shared message router instances for cost-effective development as well as a variety of plans for dedicated message routers of varying performance, scale, and high-availability. Together they meet the requirements for a range of robust test and production deployments.

One of the key strengths of Solace Messaging is its [support for many different open transports and protocols](http://dev.solace.com/tech/#multi-service), making Solace message routers ideal data distribution platforms to connect to any app.

## <a id='cloud-integration'></a>Cloud Integration 

A Solace Messaging deployment under PCF can be configured to support integration with existing cloud services and hybrid cloud deployments.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-tcp_routes'></a>TCP Routes

TCP Routes allows access to Solace messaging services hosted inside your PCF domain from external networks. By default, a PCF hosted service is not accessible to external networks.

<%= image_tag('arch_tcp_routes.png') %>

Having TCP Routes enables many use cases:

 * Hybrid cloud---other Solace appliances or VMRs deployed outside PCF can establish [Bridge](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Working-With-Message-VPN-Bridges.htm) connections to Solace messaging services inside your PCF cloud. 
 * External client apps---apps deployed outside PCF can communicate via messaging with apps deployed inside PCF by connecting to a Solace messaging service deployed in PCF.
 * IoT---devices using MQTT or REST can connect to Solace messaging services from outside PCF to communicate with your apps deployed inside PCF, look for the *TCP Routes for IoT---MQTT Java Application Tutorial* [Getting Started Samples](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/pcf-tutorials/) with full source code available in [GitHub](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-cloudfoundry-java/tcp-routes-mqtt/).
 * Mobile Apps---mobile and web apps can use [web messaging](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Web-Messaging-Concepts/Web-Messaging-Concepts.htm) to connect to Solace messaging services from outside PCF to communicate with your apps deployed inside PCF.

  To use TCP Routes, you need to [enable and configure TCP Routes at installation time](installing.html#optional_tcp_routes) with a selection of default settings for each messaging protocol that you wish to use. Once enabled, TCP Routes can be fine tuned per service at service creation time.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-system_logging'></a>System Logging

System Logging allows for redirecting the logs from the Solace Messaging PCF components to an external syslog service. To use System Logging you need to [enable and configure System Logging at installation time](installing.html#optional_system_logging).

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-ldap'></a>LDAP

Enables the use of an LDAP server for the VMR's authentication and authorization needs.
The configuration allows granting an LDAP server control over Management access and Application access.
To use LDAP you need to [Enable and configure LDAP at installation time](installing.html#optional_ldap_settings) and make a choice about [Management Access](installing.html#optional_management_access) and [Application Access](installing.html#optional_application_access).

## <a id='solace-messaging-features'></a>Solace Messaging Features

This topic describes how developers can bind an app to instances of the Solace Messaging service.

##<a id='about-bindings'></a>About Bindings

For an app deployed in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to obtain credentials for a Solace Messaging service instance,
a developer needs to bind the app to the service instance.

Binding the app to a service instance produces [Solace Messaging Credentials](credentials.html),
which become available in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable for the app as deployed in PCF.

Unbindng the app from the service instance revokes the credentials.

The following procedures assume you have created a Solace Messaging service called `solace-messaging-instance`
as discussed in [Service Instances](service-instances.html) and that you have a deployed app called `web-backend`.

The procedures show you how to bind this service instance to the app named `web-backend`. 

##<a id='bind-cf-cli'></a>Bind a Service Instance with the cf CLI

To bind an instance of the Solace Messaging service with the cf Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>

1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>


1. Locate the previously created service.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	name                        service            plan     bound apps   last operation
	solace-messaging-instance   solace-messaging   large-ha              create succeeded
	</pre>

1. Bind the instance to an app called `web-backend`.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf bind-service web-backend solace-messaging-instance
  Binding service solace-messaging-instance to app web-backend in org example / space development as user<span>@</span>example.com...
  OK
  TIP: Use 'cf restage web-backend to ensure your env variable changes take effect
  </pre>

1. Restage the app for the binding to take effect.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage web-backend
  </pre>

##<a id='apps-man'></a>Bind a Service Instance in Apps Manager

To bind an instance of the Solace Messaging service in Apps Manager, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to `apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` in a browser and log in.
1. Select the org and space in which you wish to create the Solace Messaging service.
1. Click **Apps**, click the app name **web-backend**, click **Services**, then click **Bind a Service**.
  <%= image_tag('appsmanager_solace_messaging_service_list_empty.png') %>
1. Select a service instance to bind to the app and click **Bind**.
  <%= image_tag('appsmanager_solace_messaging_bind_service_selected.png') %>
1. After the service is bound, you can find it listed under **Services**.
  <%= image_tag('appsmanager_solace_messaging_service_list_has_service.png') %>

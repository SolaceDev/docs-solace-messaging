###<a id='configure_required'></a> Required Settings

<a id='required_azs_and_network'></a>**Assign AZs and Networks**

1. From the **Settings** tab of the Solace Messaging tile, click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
    <%= image_tag('select_1_assign_azs_and_networks.png') %>
1. Under **AZ and Network Assignments**, choose the network and availability zones where Solace Messaging should run.
   If you are deploying Solace Messaging with high availability plans, consider using multiple availability zones for maximum fault tolerance.

    <%= image_tag('form_assign_azs_and_networks.png') %>
1. Click **Save**.

<a id='required_management_access'></a>**Management Access**

1. Click **Management Access**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_management_access.png') %> 
1. Under **Admin user password**, pick a password for the Virtual Message Routers `admin` user.

    <%= image_tag('form_management_access_admin_user_password.png') %>
1. [(Optional) if you want to use LDAP](#optional_management_access).

1. Click **Save**.

<a id='required_tcp_routes'></a>**TCP Routes (Save required)**

You need to open this pane and click **Save** even if using the default setting. If you want to enable TCP routes, see <a href="#optional_tcp_routes">(Optional) TCP Routes</a>.

1. Click **TCP Routes**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_tcp_routes.png') %>
1. Default: **TCP Routes Disabled**.

    <%= image_tag('form_tcp_routes.png') %>
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Failing to click <strong>Save</strong> might result in an <code>unknown property "solace_router"</code> exception when you attempt to Apply Changes.</p>

<a id='required_stemcell'></a>**Stemcell**

You might need to import a stemcell import if the minimum stemcell required for Solace Messaging for PCF is not found.

1. Click **Stemcell**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_stemcell.png') %> 
1. Click **Import Stemcell** to import the required stemcell for your installation of PCF.
  * [Download Stemcells for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells)

<a id='required_resource_config'></a>**Resource Config**

1. Click **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_resource_config.png') %> 
1. Use the drop-down menus to configure the number of VMR job instances that are available in each of the five service plans mentioned above.
   These job instances are statically created when the tile is deployed.
   Service instances are then dynamically allocated at service instance creation time, post-deployment, using these job instances.<br/><br/>
   Five Shared-VMR service instances can be hosted on a single Shared-VMR job instance.
   As such, the maximum number of Shared-VMR service instances that can concurrently exist for the <code>Shared-VMR</code> service plan is equal to five times the number of <code>Shared-VMR</code> job instances.
   Conversely, three HA VMR job instances are required for a single HA VMR service instance.
   As such, the maximum number of HA VMR service instances that can concurrently exist for the <code>Large-HA-VMR</code> and <code>Medium-HA-VMR</code> service plans is equal to one-third the number of their corresponding job instances.
   In order for <code>Large-HA-VMR</code> and <code>Medium-HA-VMR</code> service plans to provide high availability fault tolerance, make use of multiple availability zones for your deployment, with a minimum of 2 and an ideal of 3 or more.
   If you have only one availability zone, the deployment is not fault tolerant and Solace does not recommend using high availability service plans under this scenario.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The number of job instances can be increased after the tile is deployed without impacting already bound apps. However, reducing the number of instances can result in app failure and message loss.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The size of the persistent disk can be changed both before and after deployment. 
  Increasing the size of the persistent disks will impact the service of already bound apps. However, messages will not be lost. 
  Reducing the size of the persistent disk post-deployment is not recommended and can result in message loss, inoperable VMRs, and/or undefined behaviors.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Solace recommends keeping the default values for **VM Type**. A reduction of the RAM or CPU capacity may lead to a deployment failure or service degradation.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The deploy-all and delete-all are required errands for the installation and removal of the Solace Service Broker.
   Solace recommends leaving the default VM Type.
   The VM Type for these errands is not related to the required resources of the Solace Service Broker, which runs in Elastic Runtime.</p>
    <%= image_tag('form_resource_config.png') %>

1. Click **Save**.


###<a id='configure_optional'></a> Optional Settings

<a id='optional_message_router_config'></a>**(Optional) Message Router Config**

1. Click **Message Router Config**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_message_router_config.png') %> 
1. Under **Starting Port**, enter a port where the messaging services on the VMRs (e.g. MQTT, REST, or SMF) will start listening from, for example, `7000`.  
The exact port numbers chosen for each service will be based on this starting port and specified in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable passed to apps. 
For an example, see [Example Environment Variable](credentials.html#example).
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Starting Port may only be set at tile installation time. Its value may not be changed later.</p>
    <%= image_tag('form_message_router_config.png') %>

1. Click **Save**.

<a id='optional_tls_config'></a>**(Optional) TLS Config**

1. Click **TLS Config**. 

    <%= image_tag('select_1_tls_config.png') %> 

    TLS is disabled by default.

    <%= image_tag('form_tls_config.png') %> 

1. Click **TLS Enabled**.

    <%= image_tag('form_tls_config_enabled.png') %> 
By enabling and configuring TLS, you allow messaging between apps and the Solace VMRs to be encrypted. 
Apps requiring encryption would then need to use the TLS-specific URLs passed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. 
For more information about the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, see [Example Environment Variable](credentials.html#example). 
If TLS is not configured, the TLS specific URLs continue to be passed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable but fail to connect to a VMR if used.

1. Configure **Message Router's RSA certificate (Server Certificate)** either by pasting in a certificate and private key in PEM format
   or asking one to be generated by clicking **Generate RSA Certificate**. 
   Generated certificates are equivalent to self-signed certificates.

    <%= image_tag('form_tls_config_server_certificate.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The server certificate configured will be used by all Solace VMRs deployed. As such, all VMRs deployed in a PCF instances will have the same identification.</p>
    <%= image_tag('form_tls_config_disable_sb_cert_validation.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Communication between the Solace Messaging Service Broker and VMRs is also encrypted if a TLS certificate is configured. 
The Service Broker uses the Container Certificate Trust Store Framework to validate the server certificate returned by VMRs. 
So if the framework is not operational when the tile is deployed the Service Broker will be unable to validate server certificates sent by the VMRs
and the tile will fail to deploy. 
In development environments, it may be acceptable to not require server certificate validation, in which case the <strong>Disable RSA Server Certificate validation on the Service Broker (For development only)</strong> checkbox can be selected. 
This checkbox should never be selected in production deployments. Instead, the framework should be made operational.</p>

1. (Optional) Configure **Message Router's Trusted Root Certificates**.
   These certificates will be stored in the trust store on the VMRs.
   They are required if you choose to use LDAP with TLS.
    <%= image_tag('form_tls_config_trusted_root_certificates.png') %>

1. Click **Save**.

<a id='optional_service_access'></a>**(Optional) Service Access**

1. Click **Service Access**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_service_access.png') %>
1. Check the **Enable global access to plans of service solace_messaging** option.
    <%= image_tag('form_service_access.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To control access to Solace Messaging service plans on a case-by-case basis, do not enable this option.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


<a id='optional_management_access'></a>**(Optional) Management Access**

1. Click **Management Access**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_management_access.png') %> 

1. If you configured [LDAP](#optional_ldap_settings), you may choose to have the LDAP Server provide the authentication
   and authorization for the management roles on a Solace service instance.
    <%= image_tag('form_management_access_ldap.png') %>
1. (Optional) Configure Groups with VMR administration read-only privilege.
    <%= image_tag('form_management_access_ldap_readonly.png') %>
1. (Optional) Configure Groups with VMR administration read-write privileges.
    <%= image_tag('form_management_access_ldap_readwrite.png') %>
1. (Optional) Configure Groups with VMR administration administrator privileges.
    <%= image_tag('form_management_access_ldap_admin.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Cloud Operators need to have global access to the VMRs deployed by the tile.
   This will allow them to administer the VMRs with SolAdmin, CLI or SEMP-based tools.
   Cloud operators might have different roles.
   Each role requires one of the three types of access-level: administrator, read-write and read-only.
   When using "VMR Internal" the cloud operators access to a single administrator level role using the admin password.
   With "LDAP Server" users can be assigned to groups in LDAP mapping to their respective roles.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

<a id='optional_application_access'></a>**(Optional) Application Access**

1. Click **Application Access**

    <%= image_tag('select_1_application_access.png') %>
1. Using the defaults, the VMR will use its internal database for user credentials per service instance.
   If you configured LDAP, you may request the VMR to use the LDAP Server for authentication and authorization of when a client attempts to access a Solace Messaging service instance.
    <%= image_tag('form_application_access.png') %>

1. Click **Save**.

<a id='optional_ldap_settings'>**</a>(Optional) LDAP Settings**.

1. Click **LDAP Settings**

    <%= image_tag('select_1_ldap_settings.png') %>

    LDAP is disabled by default. 
  <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using the default <strong>LDAP Disabled</strong>, 
   the VMR will use its internal database for management and user credentials per service instance.
   To use an LDAP store you must select <strong>LDAP Enabled</strong> and provide all the required settings for your LDAP server. </p>
1. Click **LDAP Enabled**.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_enabled.png') %>
1. Set LDAP Server URL.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_server_url.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Consider network accessibility of the provided LDAP server,
   you may need to check the <strong>Internet Connected</strong> option in [Resource Config](#required_resource_config).</p>
1. Set LDAP TLS Preference.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_starttls.png') %>
1. Set LDAP Credentials to use with the LDAP Server.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_credentials.png') %>

1. Set User Search Base.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_user_search_base.png') %>
1. Set User Search Filter.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_user_search_filter.png') %>
1. Set User Group Membership Attribute Name.

    <%= image_tag('form_ldap_settings_user_group_membership_attribute_name.png') %>
1. Click **Save**.

In order to have an effective LDAP configuration, configure LDAP for [Management Access](#optional_management_access)
and [Application Access](#optional_application_access). 
**If neither [Management Access](#optional_management_access) nor [Application Access](#optional_application_access) are configured for LDAP, the VMR will continue to use its internal database for management and user credentials.**

<a id='optional_system_logging'></a>**(Optional) System Logging**

1. Click **System Logging**.

    <%= image_tag('select_1_system_logging.png') %>

    System logging is disabled by default.
    <%= image_tag('form_system_logging.png') %>

1. Click **System Logging Enabled**.

    <%= image_tag('form_system_logging_enabled.png') %>
1. Set the external syslog hostname.

    <%= image_tag('form_system_logging_server.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Consider network accessibility of the provided syslog server. You may need to check the <strong>Internet Connected</strong> option in [Resource Config](#required_resource_config).</p>
1. Set the external syslog port.

    <%= image_tag('form_system_logging_port.png') %>
1. Set the external syslog network protocol.

    <%= image_tag('form_system_logging_protocol.png') %>
1. Select what logs to send to the external syslog server.

## <a id='upgrades'></a>Upgrades

Solace Messaging for PCF supports upgrades starting with release 1.3.0. Future releases can upgrade a deployment if the deployment is 1.3.0 or higher.
In-Service-Upgrades are supported from release 1.3.0 for high-availability service plans.

### <a id='upgrades_non_ha'></a>Non-High Availability Upgrades

Upgrades are service-affecting for non-HA service plans <code>Shared-VMR</code>, <code>Community-VMR</code>, and <code>Large-VMR</code>.

The messaging service for an application will experience an outage that lasts no longer than the time it takes to upgrade the VMR and start it up again.

### <a id='upgrades_ha'></a>High Availability Upgrades

Upgrades are non-service-affecting for high-availability plans <code>Large-HA-VMR</code> and <code>Medium-HA-VMR</code>, so there will always be a service available during upgrades. Upgrades will affect each VM providing the HA service one at a time.

An application using an HA service will experience at least one switch-over during an upgrade, and at most two switch-overs.

Please see our [Getting Started Samples](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/pcf-tutorials/) with full source code available in [GitHub](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-cloudfoundry-java) for some examples of how HA connections are used, as well as [Configuring-Client-Connections](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-Messaging-APIs/Developer-Guide/Configuring-Connection-T.htm) for additional information on client connection setup to allow for switch-overs during upgrades.

The upgrade process is designed to keep services available. 

Failures in upgrades are due to either pre-conditions or post-conditions, and are intended to keep services available in case of any failure.

The following pre-conditions must be met before an upgrade can proceed, or the upgrade will abort.

* The version of the tile being upgraded must be version 1.3.0 or higher.
* The redundancy state of HA services must be healthy.


If any failure occurs during an upgrade, services will remain available. 

Please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.html#upgrade_errors) for further details.

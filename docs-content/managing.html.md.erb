title: Managing the Message VPN
owner: Partners

Developers can manage the Message VPN associated with a service instance by using the Dashboard URL of the service and by connecting to the Solace PubSub+ message broker via the PubSub+ Manager web browser based interface.


## <a id='solace_pubsub_service_dashboard'></a> Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard

The Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard offers a link to the [Solace PubSub+ Manager](#solace_pubsub_manager) and the ability to capture a backup of basic service configuration and restore it.

### <a id='retrieve_dashboard'></a> Retrieve Dashboard Information

1. Look for the 'Dashboard' by getting details about the created service.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf service solace-pubsub-instance-IoT

	Service instance: solace-pubsub-instance-IoT
	Service: solace-pubsub
	Bound apps:
	Tags:
	Plan: enterprise-shared
	Description: Solace PubSub+ message broker for real-time, multi-protocol data distribution
	Documentation url: http<span>:</span>//docs.solace.com
        Dashboard: https<span>:</span>//solace-service-dashboard.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/service-dashboard/ALKSJDLAKSJDLKAJSLDKJA/auth/YLLKJJ)(UASJldKAJSD*ALSKFALSGHLAKSJDlAJSLDJASLKJDALSKJDL.eHl6S

	Last Operation
	Status: create succeeded
	Message:

	</pre>

1. Use the provided URL in a browser.

## <a id='solace_pubsub_manager'></a> Solace PubSub+ Manager

The Solace PubSub+ message broker includes a browser based management interface for the Solace PubSub+ services.
The Solace PubSub+ Manager is accessible when a service is created from a link in the [Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard](#solace_pubsub_service_dashboard).

### Restrictions on the Use of the PubSub+ Manager

There are some actions that you must not perform in the PubSub+ Manager:

1. Do not change anything on the **Message VPN/Connectivity** page. Settings such as
TLS configuration must be managed through the tile.
1. On the **Message VPN/Replication** page, do not change the Replication Role.
This causes the deployment to fail.
1. Do not change anything on the **Access Control/Authentication** page.
Settings such as Authentication type must be managed through the tile. Likewise,
client usernames should be created by binding services through PCF.




## <a id='solace_pubsub_configuration_backup_and_restore'></a> Solace PubSub+ Configuration Backup and Restore

**Configuration Backup and Restore** is a **Beta** feature.

It provides the ability to capture a backup of service **configuration only** and to restore to a newly created service.

At this point it is not intended to do a full backup and restore on the same service. It should only be used to transfer limited configuration to a new service when data retention is not needed.

**Note that performing a restore will delete all persisted messages and will leave the VPN with only the objects that existed when the backup was performed.**

## <a id='manage_with_semp'></a> Managing with SolAdmin

This section describes how to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker with the SolAdmin legacy administration tool to manage the Message VPN associated with a service instance.

### <a id='retrieve_bound_app'></a> Retrieve Information From a Bound App

To retrieve the information required to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker from a bound app, do the following:

1. Log in to your deployment and choose the org and space where your Solace PubSub+ service instance and bound app exists.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>

1. View the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable by retrieving the environment variables associated with your bound app:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf env YOUR-APP
  </pre>

### <a id='retrieve_service_key'></a> Retrieve Information from a Service Key

To retrieve the information required to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker from a service key, do the following:

1. Log in to your deployment and choose the org and space where your Solace PubSub+ service instance and service key exists.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>

1. View the service key:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service-key solace-pubsub-instance my-service-key
  </pre>

### <a id='locate_credentials'></a> Locate the Management Host and Credentials

1. Both the `VCAP_SERVICES` and service key contain the same information, look for and record the following fields:
  * `managementHostnames`: The Solace PubSub+ message broker's management hostnames. There will be multiple entries for Services on HA Plans.
  * `activeManagementHostname`: A single entry that is dynamically routed to the active node for an HA service. Will always be the same as `managementHostnames` for non-HA plans.
  * When Management Access is set to `Message Broker Internal`:
      * `managementUsername`: The service instance's management username
      * `managementPassword`: The service instance's management password
  * When Management Access is set to `LDAP Server`:
      * The management username and password are to be provided by the LDAP Administrator.
  <br><br>
  For more information about the `VCAP_SERVICES` fields, see the [Understanding Credentials](credentials.html) topic.

### <a id='connect'></a> Connect to the Solace PubSub+ Message Broker

The `managementHostnames` and `activeManagementHostname` are externally accessible FQDNs and can be used directly from within SolAdmin using standard ports for HTTP (`80`) and HTTPS (`443`). The procedure is as follows:

1. Download and install the SolAdmin administration tool from the [Solace Developers Portal Download Page](http://dev.solace.com/downloads/).

1. Start SolAdmin.

1. Click **Manage** to open the **Manage Appliance** window.

    <%= image_tag('soladmin_manage.png') %>

1. Under **Management Host**, enter the active management hostname of the Solace PubSub+ message broker recorded above.

1. Under **User Name** and **Password**, enter the management username and password recorded above.

1. Click **Ok**.
   The Solace PubSub+ message broker should now appear in the **Managed Appliances** list.
